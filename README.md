# Jitsi-Meet Auth0 Authentication Module

This project integrates Auth0 authentication with Jitsi Meet, providing a robust security layer that ensures only authenticated users can access video conferencing features. The integration is built using Go and is designed to work seamlessly with NGINX as a reverse proxy that facilitates secure sessions and manages traffic flow.

## Features

- **OAuth2 Authentication**: Leverages Auth0 to handle user authentication and session management.
- **Token Validation**: Uses Auth0's JSON Web Key Sets (JWKS) for validating JWTs to secure API endpoints.
- **Session Management**: Manages user sessions to ensure a seamless user experience across the Jitsi Meet platform.
- **Secure Access**: Ensures that all communications are secured and that only authenticated users can access meeting functionalities.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them:

```bash
go version go1.15 or higher
nginx or similar HTTP server
Auth0 account
```

### Installing

A step-by-step series of examples that tell you how to get a development environment running:

1. **Clone the repository**
   
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/jitsi-auth0-service.git
   cd jitsi-auth0-service
   ```

2. **Set up environment variables**

   Create a `.env` file in the root directory and update it with your Auth0 credentials:

   ```
   AUTH0_DOMAIN=yourdomain.auth0.com
   AUTH0_CLIENT_ID=yourclientid
   AUTH0_CLIENT_SECRET=yoursecret
   AUTH0_CALLBACK_URL=https://yourcallbackurl.com/callback
   ```
3. **Build the project**

   ```go build```

4. **Run the server**

   ```./jitsi-auth0-service```

### Configuration

Configure your NGINX to proxy requests to the Go server:

   ```
   server {
      listen 443 ssl;
      server_name yourdomain.com;

       location / {
           proxy_pass http://localhost:3033;
           proxy_http_version 1.1;
           proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
           proxy_set_header Connection 'upgrade';
           proxy_set_header Host $host;
           proxy_cache_bypass $http_upgrade;
       }
    }
    ```
